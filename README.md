# Fake News Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Artificial Intelligence–based Fake News Detection System** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The system automatically classifies news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** based on their textual content.

The project was developed as part of the **CU6051NI – Artificial Intelligence** module coursework.
